# Japanese Furigana
> _A language is learned through its own kind of writing_ -- Julien Fontanier

Japanese Furigana is an Anki 2.1 add-on providing support for adding or removing furigana on Japanese content in cards.
It is intended to work cross-platforms, either on `Windows`, `MacOS` or `Linux`.

This plugin is inspired by [ClozeFuriganaTools](https://github.com/golddranks/ClozeFuriganaTools) and [Simple Furigana](https://github.com/jcsirot/anki-simple-furigana).
Japanese readings are generated by [MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) and [Kakasi](http://kakasi.namazu.org/index.html.en).

Japanese Furigana is released under GPLv3. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## Usage

Japanese Furigana adds two buttons in the card editor toolbar `Generate furigana` and `Delete furigana`

Select the field where you want to add furigana and click `Generate furigana`.
When only a portion of text is selected in the field, furigana are only generated for or removed from that selected text portion.

## Why

There is already plently of plugins available for Japanese, but most of them are incompatible with Anki 2.1 or do not work on MacOS.
I also wanted a plugin that respects the **KISS principle**, that states that softwares should be kept as simple as possible.
